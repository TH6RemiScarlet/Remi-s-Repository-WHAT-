#btw, if u wonder why I sometimes fill my project with green text and sometimes I don't it's cuz I just do it as I need to.
#For example, my second period last project (the peakest thing I have ever done to date) was absolutely filled with way too much green text
#1: It's literally the second period final project, and 2: there was a lot of technical stuff and process
#I also placed a lot cuz I thought I was gonna stand and explain my code to everyone lol (that's literally the purpose of the green text in my project)

#I'd also like to ask for you to not subtract me points for the second function: I know it's supposed to be like; You select a specific
#Item from the list to delete, but really by the time I was doing the code I was running out of time, Didn't really know how to do that
#And didn't want to resort to directly cheating, so Instead I went through the route of just deleting your previous item.


#And I must confess
#I told you all of that
#To ask


#Do you by any chance know what happened in the final project delivery day????? I'm still bugged out by the fact that my thing didn't work
#on your pc


#Update: for all of yall readin in github
#go play touhou 6 you should totally try it fr fr fr fr fr fr fr fr fr fr
